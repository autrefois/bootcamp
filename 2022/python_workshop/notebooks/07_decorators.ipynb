    "\n",
    "## So what is a decorator anyway?\n",
    "By definition, a decorator takes another function and *extends* its behaviour without explicitly modifying it.\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "**Recall**: a function returns a value based in the given parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions may also have side effects other than turning an input into an output. For example, the print() function returns None, while having the side effect of printing something to the console. \n",

    "In order to understand decorators, it's enough to think of functions as something that return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Class objects\n",
