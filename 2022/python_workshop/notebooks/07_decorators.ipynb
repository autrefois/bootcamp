    "# Decorators\n",

    "By the end of this session, you will know what decorators are, how to create and use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## So what is a decorator anyway?\n",
    "By definition, a decorator takes another function and *extends* its behaviour without explicitly modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this may sounds confusing at first, it's really not - it will all make sense once you see some examples of how decorators work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "**Recall**: a function returns a value based in the given parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions may also have side effects other than turning an input into an output. For example, the print() function returns None, while having the side effect of printing something to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand decorators, it's enough to think of functions as something that return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Class objects\n",
    "In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed as parameters. just like any other objects."
