    "## Building generators with generator expressions\n",
    "Generator expressions, just like list comprehentions, allow you to create a generator object with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are also useful in the same cases list comprehensions are used, without building and holding the object in memory before iteration.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you call a generator function or use a generator expression, it returns an iterator. When you call special methods on the resulted iterator, such as `next()`, the function is executed up to `yield`.\n",

When a function execution is suspended, its state is preserved (variable bindings local to the generator, internal stack, instruction pointer etc).\n",
